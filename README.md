# TO DO App

## This App is regarding the code along project for the JavaScript and JQuery Fundamental project.

- Users type in the input field and press enter.

- As soon as they press enter we’ll take their input and add it as a list item to the unordered list under the input field.
- When a user clicks on a list item, the “checkbox” should get filled and the text should turn grey to indicate that the item has been completed.
- Allow the removal of items completely from the list
- drag/drop sort items (have a look at jQuery UI)
- when the page loads focus on the input field (i.e. cursor should load inside input, ready to type)
- reduce lookups with variables
- error if input is empty
- automatically move completed items to the bottom
